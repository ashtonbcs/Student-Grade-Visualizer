# Student-Grade-Visualizer
Processing and Visualizing Grades of Students.
This project makes it easier to manipulate the grades of students. It is easier to find averages and find out where each student lands on a graph next to they're peers. Teachers could use this with ease all thats needed is a csv with the grades of the students. Take the csv and place it in the python folder where you are running the code. This project was very interesting to me because i aspire to be a data scientist, creating a program to practice processing and vizualizing data was very fun.
